This application is an offline ray tracer that asks the user for an absolute path to a scene file (.txt) and then
renders that scene on the screen using ray tracing.

Uses an external obj loader called tiny_obj_loader found at:
https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader

From visual studio: make sure the configuration is set to x86.
